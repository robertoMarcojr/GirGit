# GirGit

**GirGit** is a privacy-first, keyboard-driven desktop AI assistant designed for focused workflows.

It runs entirely on the user’s system and lets users interact with AI providers like **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** using their **own accounts**. GirGit does not proxy, store, or transmit user data.

- No APIs, no backend, no telemetry  
- Keyboard-centric interaction  
- Optional interactive mode when needed  
- Built to stay out of the way and respect user privacy

## Key Features

- Global keyboard shortcuts for fast AI access  
- User-controlled login to ChatGPT / Gemini

- Multiple lightweight windows (mini, preview, main)

## Privacy

GirGit acts only as a **local interface layer**.

All AI interactions happen directly between the user and the selected AI provider.  
No data is collected, logged, or sent to any third party by GirGit.

---

## Interaction Modes

- **Keyboard mode (default)** — fully shortcut-driven  
- **Interactive mode** — enables mouse interaction when explicitly toggled  

Users remain in full control at all times.

---

## Responsible Use

GirGit is intended for productivity and accessibility use cases.  
Users are responsible for complying with the rules and policies of the environments in which they use the software.
